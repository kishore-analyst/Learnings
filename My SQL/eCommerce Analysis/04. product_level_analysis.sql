Good morning,
We launched our second product back on January 6th. Can

Subject: Help w/ User Pathing

Hi there!
Now that we have a new product, I'm thinking about our
user path and conversion funnel. Let's look at sessions which
hit the /products page and see where they went next.
Could you please pull clickthrough rates from /products
since the new product launch on January 6th 2013, by
product, and compare to the 3 months leading up to launch
as a baseline?
Thanks, Morgan

Hi there!
I'd like to look at our two products since January 6th and
analyze the conversion funnels from each product page to
conversion.
It would be great if you could produce a comparison between
the two conversion funnels, for all website traffic.
Thanks!
